// HTML Events

// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

// Here are some examples of HTML events:

//     An HTML web page has finished loading
//     An HTML input field was changed
//     An HTML button was clicked

// Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

// JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

// HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

//  What will we do in Event Secction

// 1)  four ways to writing events in JS

// 2) what is event Object

// 3) mouse events in javasccript

// 4) input events in javascript

//               sectiion - 1)  four ways to writing events in JS        //


// 1) using inline event alert();

// 2) by calling a function (we already seen most comman way to writing)

// 3) using inline events (HTML onclick="property and element. onclick")

// 4) using addEventListener(addEventListener and ie's attach event)





//  2nd way of writing function

//     alert('Most comman way to writing function');
// }
